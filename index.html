          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            As a penultimate-year civil engineering student, I am driven by a
            deep passion for infrastructure, water resources, and geotechnical
            engineering. My enthusiasm extends to outreach and education, as I
            am committed to making a positive impact both at the university and
            in the broader community. My involvement in various initiatives has
            developed my leadership and communication skills, evident from my
            role in organising and leading multiple education and outreach
            events. For instance, in a team of three, I co-organised the 2023
            New Zealand Physics and Mathematics Competition (NZPMC) North Island
            Finals, which hosted over 150 high school students.
          </p>

            As one of the 16 UniGuide Leaders, I play a crucial role in
            organising and managing the Orientation Week for first-year
            undergraduate students, accommodating over a thousand attendees
            daily. Within the training sub-team, I am responsible for creating
            resources and guiding a team of over 130 volunteers to ensure a
            smooth orientation process.

            The photo on the left captures me leading a Robogals training event,
            where I instructed volunteers on the upcoming Bridge Building
            workshop content that Robogals will present at local libraries and
            schools. As the training manager for Robogals this year, I developed
            resources for three different workshops: Bridge Building, Mbot
            Pathfinding, and Sphero Arcade. I successfully hosted three training
            sessions this year, effectively training more than 90 volunteers.
