      <h2>Tutoring</h2>
      <p>
        Kia ora ! I am Roger, a passionate tutor for maths and physics. Over the
        past two years, I have guided students in Year 9-13 level mathematics
        and physics towards achieving their academic goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an Engineering GPA of 8.79 out of 9, I was on the University of
        Auckland Deanâ€™s Honours List for the past two years. I received A*A*A*A
        at Cambridge A level and received NZQA Scholarships in three subjects.
        In addition to teaching high school students, this year I have served as
        a teaching assistant for two university courses: CIVIL 202 Fluid
        Mechanics and EGGEN 121 Engineering Mechanics where I am responsible for
        conducting laboratory demonstrations and guiding students through
        problem-solving exercises on the board for class size of 30+ students. I
        have provided weekly academic support in the past two years to first and
        second-year engineering students as a Part I and Part II Assistance
        Centre mentor.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience extends to teaching younger children about STEM in a small
        group setting, where I took on the role of Lead Volunteer for Robogals.
        With this diverse teaching background, I bring a wealth of knowledge and
        experience to my tutoring sessions. I am committed to making learning
        engaging and accessible for all my students.
